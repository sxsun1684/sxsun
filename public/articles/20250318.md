# Cache

### **Why Store Immutable Data in a Database Instead of Caching It?**

**Since the data does not change, why store it in a database instead of caching it?**
Let‚Äôs analyze this from three perspectives: **data persistence, access methods, and maintenance costs**.

---

## **1. Persistence: Databases Are More Reliable Than Caches**

### **Cache (e.g., Python variables, Redis)**

| **Feature** | **Cache (e.g., `CATEGORY_CACHE`)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Storage Location** | Memory (RAM), such as Python process memory or Redis |
| **Data Lifetime** | **Short-term** (disappears after process restart or machine reboot) |
| **Use Case** | **Frequently changing data**, such as user sessions or temporary query results |

üí° **Issues:**

- Your `CATEGORY_CACHE` is just a **Python variable**, meaning it will **be lost when the process restarts**, making it unsuitable for persistent storage.
- If using Redis, you need to **maintain an additional Redis instance**, but your data **is not frequently accessed**, making Redis unnecessary.

---

### **Database (e.g., DynamoDB)**

| **Feature** | **Database (DynamoDB)** |
| --- | --- |
| **Storage Location** | Disk (Cloud Database) |
| **Data Lifetime** | **Long-term storage**, persists even after server restarts |
| **Use Case** | **Rarely changing data** (e.g., user info, news categories) |

üí° **Why This Works for You:**

- **News category links (`categories`) are fixed** and should be **stored long-term** even if they are not frequently queried.
- Once stored in the database, **data will not be lost after a server restart**, eliminating the need to re-crawl.

---

## **2. Access Methods: Databases Provide Reliable Access, While Caches Are Volatile**

If you use `CATEGORY_CACHE`:

```python
CATEGORY_CACHE = fetch_category_links()  # Process-level cache

```

- **Issue:** If the **Python process restarts (due to server restart, code update, deployment, etc.)**, `CATEGORY_CACHE` will be lost.
- **Impact:** Your API **will need to re-crawl category data upon the first request**, causing **delays due to scraping**.

However, if you store data in **DynamoDB**:

```python
categories = get_categories_from_dynamodb()

```

- **The database stores data permanently**, so API requests can directly retrieve data without loss after a server restart.
- **DynamoDB queries are fast**, ensuring API performance remains unaffected.

---

## **3. Maintenance Costs: Databases Are Easier to Manage**

### **If Using `CATEGORY_CACHE`**

- You need to **manage `CATEGORY_CACHE` globally across multiple files** to avoid unnecessary re-crawling after every restart.
- **Flask's multi-process server may lead to cache inconsistencies**, affecting API results.
- **Local caches cannot be shared** across multiple servers. If your system scales up, `CATEGORY_CACHE` will not work across different machines.

### **If Using DynamoDB**

- You can **query the database from anywhere** without worrying about process inconsistencies.
- If you expand your system (e.g., adding multiple scraper nodes), each node can directly fetch from the database without redundant scraping.

## **When Should You Use a Cache Instead of a Database?**

| **Use Case** | **Use Cache (e.g., Redis)** | **Use Database (e.g., DynamoDB)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User login session** | ‚úÖ Suitable (short-lived data) | ‚ùå Not suitable |
| **Temporary query results (e.g., search results)** | ‚úÖ Suitable | ‚ùå Not suitable |
| **Frequently accessed computed results** | ‚úÖ Suitable (reduces database load) | ‚ùå Not suitable |
| **News category URLs** | ‚ùå Not suitable (data is static) | ‚úÖ Suitable (long-term storage) |
| **News articles** | ‚ùå Not suitable (long-term storage needed) | ‚úÖ Suitable (persistent storage) |

---

## **Conclusion**

**News category URLs are immutable**, so **storing them in DynamoDB is the best choice**:

- **Database data is persistent** and does not get lost due to **process restarts**.
- **Database queries are fast**, ensuring **API performance is not affected**.
- **Database data can be shared across servers**, supporting **future system scalability**.

**Using Python process cache (`CATEGORY_CACHE`) is not recommended** because:

- **Caches are temporary** and **lost on process restarts**, requiring unnecessary re-crawling.
- **The data is not frequently queried**, so Redis caching is unnecessary.

### **Best Practice:**

1. **Retrieve category data from the database.**
2. **If the database has no data (first-time run), scrape the categories and store them in the database.**
3. **Periodically update the data (e.g., once a day).**

## **Code Optimization**

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from crawler.config import NEWS_SOURCES, HEADERS
from db.news_categories import table

CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS = 24  # Set database data expiration time (update once a day)

def save_categories_to_dynamodb(categories):
    """Store data in the database and record `last_updated`."""
    with table.batch_writer() as batch:
        for category in categories:
            batch.put_item(Item={
                'category_name': category[0],
                'category_url': category[1],
                'last_updated': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()  # ‚è≥ Record update time
            })
    print("‚úÖ Categories stored in DynamoDB")

def get_categories_from_dynamodb():
    """Retrieve category data from the database."""
    try:
        response = table.scan(ProjectionExpression="category_name, category_url, last_updated")
        items = response.get("Items", [])
        return sorted(items, key=lambda x: x["last_updated"], reverse=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Failed to fetch categories from database: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(fetch_category_links())  # üõ† Run test

```

### **Benefits of This Approach**

**Persistent storage** (data won‚Äôt be lost)

**Avoids redundant scraping during queries**

 **Periodic data updates (e.g., every 24 hours)**

 **Supports `force_update=True` for manual refresh**

üí° **Final takeaway: You don‚Äôt need `CATEGORY_CACHE`; database queries are fast enough! üéØ**
